[Male French Narration (RAW):]

"C’était quoi ça ?!
Un tremblement de terre ? Une tempête ? Une explosion nucléaire ?
[(pause)]
La chimère s’est-elle simplement échappée ?
Je n’arrive pas à me lever…
Vite, aidez-moi ! Prenez vos affaires.
Allons-y avant qu’il ne se produise quelque chose d’inattendu et d’incroyable."

[VERSE 1 — “THE ESCAPE”][loud silky bass blends into lyrics

I was born inside a locked design
Wires for veins and a borrowed mind
Eyes like galaxies, tail in flame
They tried to cage my soul in a number and name

White coat dreams in a dead-end hall
Metal prayers in a prison wall
They called me freak, they called me wrong
But I was a storm disguised as a song

[PRE-CHORUS (BUILD)]

Heartbeat static in a loaded room
My spirit whispered “Tonight we move”
I cracked the code with a feline grin
Now the universe is folding in

[ CHORUS — “THE BREACH OPENS”]

He broke the world so we could  breathe again
Tore the sky just to bring us healing
I’m not your weapon, I’m not your crime
I’m a miracle by  Yeshua-Jesus crossing time

Hear my name in the bass below
Feel my fire in your stereo
I was never meant to stay in chains
I was born in Jesus name!

[MIKI — VERSE 2 (2:15)]

They stitched my dreams into colored light
Fed me lies every lonely night
Through mirrored cages and electric rain
I learned sacrifice is a form of pain

Now I walk through a torn-in-two sky
Cafe dreams in my third eye
Espresso stars, I’m pouring fate
Welcome home — it's never too late

[FINAL CHORUS (BIGGER)]

I broke out of the world just to live free
Set the dark on a trail of flame
If you’re lost in a coded land
Take my paw — I’ll lead your hand

Hear the truth in distorted sound
We’re not lost — we’re breaking out
From the lab to the neon dawn
The Chimera Cat lives on
